Real Speed Limits
===================

The purpose of this app is to inform the user of their **REAL** speed limits.

For example, as older vehicle construction regulations allowed a speedometer accuracy of +/- 10%, in the United Kingdom ACPO guidelines recommend a tolerance level of the speed limit "+10% +2 mph".

E.g:  a maximum tolerance in a 30 mph (50 km/h) zone of 30 + (30 Ã— 10% = 3) + 2 = 35 mph).
