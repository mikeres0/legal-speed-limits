# Notes

* [developers.here.com](developers.here.com) provides a good API for speed limit data
* An example for getting the speed limits of the nearest road using here.com's api can be found [here](http://heremaps.github.io/examples/explorer.html#speed-limit-on-click__index). The result is returned in KM/PH and needs to be converted to the local unit of measure (UK = MPH).
* For the early prototype forget about the live map as the app background. Focus on sending lat/long positions and receiving back accurate speed limit data.
